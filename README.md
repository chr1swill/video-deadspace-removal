# Removal Deadspace for Videos

I love recording videos but editing can really be a drag. I find most of my time editing is just find spot where I left the recording going and I was not doing anything worth watching. This creates a bunch of still frames that I later need to go cut out so that the video is consise.

Doing this is a pain and sucks all the fun out creating videos, so I made this tool to automate that process and let me focus on the fun parts of editing vidoes.

## Installation

To use this you need to have ffmpeg and libpng installed on your system.

### Installing Dependencies

#### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt install libpng-dev
sudo apt install ffmpeg
```
#### MacOs

```bash
brew install libpng
brew install ffmpeg
```
#### Windows

good luck!

./build.sh
```

## Ussage

```
